# Frontend Context

## Stack

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript-first

## Frontend conventions

- Keep components small and focused.
- Prefer composition over large monolithic components.
- Use Tailwind for styling instead of custom CSS unless there is a real reason.
- Keep props minimal and descriptive.
- Prefer local state when practical.
- Avoid duplicated state and unnecessary re-renders.
- Model loading, empty, error, and success states explicitly.
- Keep accessibility in mind.
- Preserve the project's existing UI patterns and spacing conventions.

## Suggested expectations for the agent

- Identify the exact components, hooks, and styles involved.
- Describe state flow clearly.
- If a UI change affects behavior, mention edge cases and empty states.
- If a component is becoming too large, suggest a clean split.

## Admin design system (as of Aug 2026)

- The admin panel has its own scoped theme via the `.admin-theme` class
  (`apps/web/src/index.css`): "studio night" surfaces, signal-amber primary,
  and a tally red (`--tally`) reserved exclusively for live/on-air states.
  The public site keeps its own `:root` tokens; do not mix them.
- Semantic tokens mapped in `tailwind.config.js`: `sunken`, `faint`,
  `success`, `warning`, `info`, `tally`, plus shadcn defaults. Use these
  instead of literal slate utilities in admin pages (migration is partial:
  Dashboard, Login, and Layout are done).
- Fonts: IBM Plex Sans Variable (UI) + IBM Plex Mono (timecodes, IPs, IDs,
  section eyebrows). Loaded via @fontsource in `main.tsx`.
- Tailwind token colors require `/ <alpha-value>` in their mapping for
  opacity modifiers (`bg-primary/10`) to generate CSS. Do not remove it.
- The global 44px touch-target rule is reset inside `.admin-theme`; admin
  buttons size via component utilities.
- Shared admin pieces: `StationStatusProvider`/`useStationStatus` (single
  now-playing poll, 20s), `components/admin/OnAirStrip` (tally light +
  progress hairline, mounted in the topbar).
- Sidebar nav is grouped into Emisión / Contenido / Audiencia sections;
  the topbar derives the page title from that same structure.
- Data loaders use `.then` chains on purpose: react-hooks v7 flags
  setState reachable from functions invoked inside effects.
- Pending design debt: migrate remaining pages off literal slate classes,
  unify duplicated DetailRow/status-badge maps/skeletons, single
  SegmentedControl and Checkbox, keyboard access for the upload dropzone,
  replace the native confirm() in AdminScheduleCategories.
